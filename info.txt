MACHINE-SETUP
Machine is a RPi 2 B+ or 3 B+, using Raspbian 32 bits.
Sudo is mike, password is the standard linux
A USB flash drive (MECA-MEDIA) should be inserted.
An ESI GIGAPORT eX should be connected via USB.

PATCH
Pd patch directory/path: /home/mike/Desktop/MECA.pd
puredata vanilla + GUI should be installed on the machine.
No externals are required.
At startup the patch should generate a short "beep" on all 4 channels.
5 seconds after the beep, MAIN.WAV will start, and loop until
the machine is off.

MESIA
MEDIA-MECA directory/path: /home/media/mike/MECA-MEDIA
The media file (MAIN.WAV) is located on a flashdrive (MECA-MEDIA)
To update the file, simply put another 44.1/16 4 channels MAIN.WAV
on the MECA-MEDIA flashdrive;
If the power supply of the Pi is interrupted suddenly
it is possible that /media/mike/ will conserve a corrupted directory at reboot
see AUTOSTART to read more on how to fix that issue;

UPDATE
The patch can be updated via SSH or desktop;
SSH is activated, IP address of the ethernet port is 169.254.13.70;

AUTOSTART
Autostart directory/path: /home/mike/.config/autostart/MECA.desktop
The autostart is a .desktop file, containting a bash script
---------------
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=MECA
Exec=bash /home/mike/Desktop/autostartMECA.sh
---------------

The bash script takes care of removing any corrupted, empty directories in /media/mike/
sleeps 2 seconds before opening the Pd patch;
---------------
#bin!/bash
cd /media/mike
sudo find . -type d -empty -print -delete
sleep 2
pd home/mike/Desktop/MECA.pd
---------------

If the name of the patch is changed during an update,
it must be changed in the bash script as well. Example:
pd /home/mike/Desktop/newPatch.pd
